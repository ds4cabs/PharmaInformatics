# ðŸ’Š PharmaInformatics

**Reusable scripts for end-to-end pharmaceutical R&D.**

PharmaInformatics is a curated collection of Python/R scripts covering the full drug development lifecycleâ€”from **target discovery** to **commercial strategy**. Designed for computational biologists, data scientists, and pharma innovators.

## ðŸ§ª Scope

This project spans the full pharmaceutical R&D lifecycle, including Target Identification (e.g., gene prioritization, genetic evidence integration), Hit Discovery (compound screening, cheminformatics), Preclinical Development (transcriptomic QC, in vivo model analysis), Clinical Development (patient stratification, biomarker discovery), Manufacturing & Supply Chain (process analytics, quality signal monitoring), and Commercial Strategy (unmet need detection, GPT-powered market intelligence), aiming to provide reusable, modular scripts for each functional domain.

## How to Contribute

Contributing is simple! Just follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**.
2. **Add a new script**â€”it can be in **R**, **Python**, **Bash**, **Java**, or any other language.
3. Place your script in the `src/` folder.
4. Make sure your script can be executed from the command line using a format like:

```
./src/pubmed2target.sh -d 2025 -j nature -o pubmed_nature.csv
```
